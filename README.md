This project, named "Personal Scheduled Tweets", is a web application developed in Ruby on Rails. It allows users to schedule their tweets for future dates and times.

The application provides an interface where users can write their tweets, and then choose a specific date and time in the future when they want each tweet to be posted. This is particularly useful for users who want to maintain a consistent presence on Twitter, but may not have the time to post regularly.

The scheduling functionality is powered by Sidekiq, a simple and efficient background processing library for Ruby. Sidekiq uses threads to handle many jobs at the same time in the same process, and relies on Redis, a fast in-memory database, for storing job data.

The application also integrates with the Twitter API, which allows it to post tweets to the user's Twitter account at the scheduled times. Users need to authenticate with their Twitter account and grant the application permission to post tweets on their behalf.

In addition to the core scheduling functionality, the application also provides features for managing scheduled tweets. Users can view a list of all their scheduled tweets, and have the option to edit or delete tweets before they are posted.
